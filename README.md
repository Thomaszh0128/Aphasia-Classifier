# Aphasia-Classifier
I am a high school student from Hsinchu, Taiwan.
I use Bert model and CNN model to extract semantic and POS(part of speech) and gramatic and time-related information from CHA files.
Our model can be used to determine which type of aphasia one might have with descriptions of that aphasia type and probability distribution.
Our corpus comes from Aphasia bank(NIH-NIDCD R01-DC008524).
